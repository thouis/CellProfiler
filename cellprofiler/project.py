    '''Project is the grab-bag for CellProfiler experiment-wide information
    
    The Project class is the top-level of the hierarchy of experiment
    information. It contains several types of information:
    
    * The URLs of the 2D image planes in the experiment. Typically, there is one
      URL per image file. However, for composites such as movies, flex files
      or multichannel .TIF files, one URL per plane is saved and enough
      information is encoded in the URL to find the plane within the file.
      It's up to the system at large to use a special URL schema for this,
      like file+image://
      
    * Metadata associated with the URL. This is completely denormalized so that
      a metadata key/value pair is assigned to a single image plane. This means
      that, for cases like a movie with 3 channels of a site in a well,
      well-specific metadata will be applied to every frame of every channel
      of every site in the well, leading to thousand-fold duplication. So be it.
      
    * Urlsets. A urlset is a grouping of image planes created by a user
      so that the user can perform operations on a subset of all URLS. For
      instance, a user might want to extract file name metadata using a
      pattern that applies to only files in a certain directory or wants
      to create an imageset using the files for just one plate.
      
    * Imagesets. An imageset (as opposed to image set in the old terminology) is
      a 2D array of urls with each row representing the images for one pipeline
      iteration and each column representing the images for one
      channel. Generally, but not necessarily, the imageset is organized by
      metadata keys. One metadata key is used to determine an image plane's
      channel (i.e., ImageName in CellProfiler) and a set of other keys are
      used to locate the row in which the image plane belongs (i.e., which other
      images to group with). Each row has a unique set of values for the keys.
      
    * Pipelines.
    
    * Measurements.
    
    The project uses some backend to implement a standardized interface.
    The project also synchronizes access to all state somewhat brutally
    using a lock that's taken on entry into any of its functions. If you
    need coarser-grained synchronization to guarantee consistent state at
    some higher level (and I think the operations are coarse enough and
    atomic enough for that not to be necesary), you can take self.lock
    yourself.
